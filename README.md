# Masked_Face_Detection-Recognition

check the <b>demo.mp4</b> to check how it works

## Description

* machine learing project 
* Deep Learning
* SSD
* inception Net and ResNet

Nowadays, people have to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But,the FaceID on iPhone or iPad devices only works without masks. It is invonvenient for users. This is why I want to create this project 

## Getting Started

### Libraries

* openCV
* Numpy
* Tensorflow
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* os
* json
* math
* Dlib (for create mask face data)
* dependency on inception_resnet_v1 : http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

### data

* training data: CASIA
* test data: lfw
* part of google face data

### Executing program

* run the real_time_face_recognition.py. Using computer camera catch video stream detection face and recognition. 
* using the trained recognition model.
