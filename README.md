# Masked_Face_Detection-Recognition

check the <b>demo.mp4</b> to check how it works

## Description

* machine learing project 
* Deep Learnign

Nowadays, people have to wear masks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But,the FaceID on iPhone or iPad devices only works without masks. It is invonvenient for users. This is why I want to create this project
